		<p> Hello there. I’m Jeffrey Smith. A painter, teacher, and generally artsy guy living in Saint Paul, Minnesota.</p>
		
		<h3>The Short History</h3>
		
		<p>One of my earliest memories is sitting on the kitchen floor with my beagle Casey, and drawing for hours on end.</p>
		
		<p>We had this huge coffee can full of crayons.  I used to dig through it looking for just the right color to draw on a fresh sheet of typing paper.  My mother tells me that I used to do this almost every day, right after watching Mr. Rogers on PBS.</p>
		
		<p>Though I’m still living in St. Paul, Minnesota, I have moved up from those crayons and typing paper, and on to oil paint, goache, and pastel.  I’m happily still digging through my supplies searching for just the right color.</p>
		
		<p>I’m a graduate of The Atelier Studio Program of Fine Art in Minneapolis, Minnesota; class of 2003. After completing The Atelier’s four year program, I’ve been invited to come back and teach.  It’s something that I love doing still to this day.</p>
